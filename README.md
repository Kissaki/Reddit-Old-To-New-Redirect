# Reddit Old To New Redirect - Firefox Add-on

Redirect `old.reddit` (old layout) pages to the corresponding new page (`old.reddit.com` â†’ `www.reddit.com`).

Users that use `old.reddit.com` may copy and post links in the comments or reddit posts that link to `old.reddit.com`. This is undesired for users of the current and standard reddit layout.

In order to prevent confusion to users, or as a conscious decision to use the new layout over the old one, or to use the default one over a mixture of the two for consistency, links to `old.reddit.com` need to be replaced or redirected to the corresponding normal page.

Rather than injecting into the webpage and rewriting links this addon will redirect opened links to the default version of the page. So links will still be visible as `old.reddit.com`, but when opened will lead to the correct, new, default layout version of the page.
